11,Lil Nas D,Two weeks ago I started doing this course thinking that it would be useful for my placements  and today I'm here to let you know that because of your teaching I actually learnt DBMS and got placed in an MNC .The recruiter asked me about DBMS functions and in particular he asked me about group by function which I otherwise wouldn't  have answered . I'm really grateful for you and thank you very much Sir for taking your time to explain DBMS to us.
